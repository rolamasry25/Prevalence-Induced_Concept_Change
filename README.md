# Prevalence-Induced Concept Change

This is a simple interactive experiment based on the 2018 research paper by Levari et al., titled *“Prevalence-Induced Concept Change in Human Judgment”*.

**What it does:**  
Participants are shown a series of items (e.g. colored dots) and must decide whether each item belongs to a certain category. As the prevalence of items changes, we can observe if their concept boundary shifts — just like in the original psychological experiment.
